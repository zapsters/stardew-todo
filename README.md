## About

A todo web app in the style of stardew valley graphics! This is my solo passion project I have been working on and I hope you like it!

This is my first todo app I have made, so if you have any suggestions feel free to share your ideas!

## Version: 0.9.3 | Finishing Development

Things are wrapping up for this project! Corners are being rounded, things being tested, and users are using.

- Categories are now available for tasks and sorting!
- Due dates no longer required :)
- Tasks can be deleted, no matter if completed or uncompleted.
- Save data is functional, uses local storage and features autosaves.
